# advent-of-code-solutions

Advent of Code is an annual programming event where participants solve daily puzzles. Each day, two new challenges are released, increasing in complexity.

These puzzles are designed to improve problem-solving skills and are language-agnostic, so you can solve them in your favorite programming language.

I have managed to place on leaderboard **first 100** on **Day 13** and **Day 20**:
